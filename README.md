# Enigma-Machine-c-
This is a reproduction of the Enigma machine in C++.

 It's a console application which encodes your messages just like the Enigma machine did during the World War II for example.
 I made it on my own because I really like cryptography. I was so curious to understand the real functioning of such a Machine which was called "The Unbreakable".
 
 It is not over yet because I work on a lot of personal projects for the moment and I'm also Studying Computer science at University.
